# CRT-Paillier-CRTII-RSA
Research on CRT-based Fast Homomorphic Encryption Scheme

Homomorphic encryption has attracted the attention of many scholars in the field of information security, Which as one of the important privacy computing theoretical methods. Homomorphic encryption can directly perform calculations on encrypted data, and the decrypted result is equal to the result of calculating the plaintext. This property of homomorphic encryption also aligns with the "usable but not visible" data access requirements of privacy computing. Homomorphic encryption can be divided into fully homomorphic encryption(FHE) and partially homomorphic encryption(PHE). Compared with FHE schemes, PHE schemes have higher computational efficiency, but its still cannot meet the computational efficiency requirements of privacy computing and cannot support the large-scale deployment of privacy-enhancing computing applications based on homomorphic encryption. To solve the efficiency problem of PHE schemes, we first proposed three homomorphic encryption acceleration models based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem(CRT) by using the CRT to decompose the combination of moduli or exponentiation in the calculation process,  thereby achieving the goal of improving the efficiency of each calculation process in the homomorphic encryption scheme; secondly, by combining traditional PHE scheme and homomorphic encryption acceleration models, we designed and implemented a new CRT-Paillier scheme; in addition, by studying the CRT-RSA scheme in detail, we proposed a new CRTII-RSA scheme; Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that CRT-Paillier enhances encryption efficiency by 72.93\% and overall efficiency by 34.88\%. In comparison to the original RSA, CRTII-RSA exhibits an overall efficiency improvement of 120.38\%.
